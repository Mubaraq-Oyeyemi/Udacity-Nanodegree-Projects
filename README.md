# Udacity-Nanodegree-Projects
This is repository of projects that were Undertaken in my Udacity Nanodegree Program

The aim of this repository is to showcase my udacity's project. This will show the neccessary steps I am taking on my way to become a world class Machine Learning Engineer. Further projects will be added to my Github profile.

The details of the projects are shown below.

1. Supervised Classification Project - In this project, I worked on a supervised classification model to donors for a Charity Organization.

2. Unspervised Learning Project -In this project, I successfully performed customer segmentation on a real life dataset of Arvanto Financial Serivces. The aim of this project is  to find similarities between existing cutomers and a new dataset and use these similarities to segment customers into distinct categories using various clustering techniques.

3. Deep Learning Project - In this project, I implemented an image classification application using a deep learning model on a dataset of images.
